Foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Prof. Fumio Teraoka for the continuous support of my bachelor thesis study and research. His guidance helped me all the time in research and writing of this thesis. 

Besides my advisor, I am deeply grateful to my mentor Assistant Prof. Takao Kondo. Without his help and contribution this thesis would not have been possible.

Finally, I would like to thank my family for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and the process of researching and writing thesis. 

This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. Thank you.
