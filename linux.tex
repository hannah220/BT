The proposing Kernel-based NFCI makes use of existing Netfilter subsystem in Linux kernel. In this chapter detailed description about this Netfilter subsystem is given. 

\section{Netfilter: Overview}
Netfilter is a software inside the Linux 2.4.x and later kernel series, which enables packet filtering and packet mangling. It is a set of hooks that are placed in several stages in network stack and in each hook multiple kernel modules can be registered. Each of the kernel module will work as a NF, such as Firewall and NAPT. 
Figure \ref{fig: netfilter_system} shows the network stack and five netfilter hooks embedded inside it. The bottom is the device driver and the more it goes up the network layer does as well to reach the transport protocol (Layer 4). As packets progress through the stack, the registered kernel modules in the hook will be triggered. 
The following hooks are located in meaningful positions in the stack:
\begin{itemize}
	\item PRE\_ROUTING : This hook is triggered by incoming packet soon after entering the network stack. This is processed before the packet reaches the routing subsystem.
	\item LOCAL\_IN : This hook is processed after the packet has been routed and is destined to the local host.
	\item FORWARD : This hook is processed after the packet has been routed and is to be forwarded to another host. 
	\item LOCAL\_OUT : This hook is triggered by locally created packet as soon as it enters the stack.
	\item POST\_ROUTING : This is the last hook that the outgoing or transmitted packet passes before being put out on the wire. 
\end{itemize}

Kernel modules that are registered in a hook according to the its priority. The lower the priority value is, the earlier it gets executed. Each kernel module will return a verdict indicating the result of the process. 

\section{Netfilter: Table}
Netfilter supports Firewall, NAPT and so on. Each of these NF has its own "Table" to organize the rules. Rule is used to specify which kind of flow is targeted for the specific action, such as filtering in case of Firewall. In each netfilter hook, the following tables can be registered. 

\begin{table}[tb]

	\caption{List of tables in Netfilter hooks}	
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		\backslashbox{Tables}{Hooks} & 	PREROUING & INPUT & FORWARD & OUTPUT & POSTROUTING \\
		\hline
		\hline
		Mangle & $\bigcirc$ & $\bigcirc$ & $\bigcirc$ & $\bigcirc$ & $\bigcirc$ \\
		\hline
		CT & $\bigcirc$ & & & $\bigcirc$ & \\
		\hline
		DNAT & $\bigcirc$ & & & $\bigcirc$ & \\
		\hline
		Filter & & $\bigcirc$ & $\bigcirc$ & $\bigcirc$ & \\
		\hline
		SNAT & & $\bigcirc$ & & & $\bigcirc$ \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Mangle Table : Mangle Table is used to alter the IP headers of the packet in various ways. For instance, one can adjust the TTL value of a packet to either lengthen or shorten the number of network hops. 
	\item Connection Tracking Table (CT) : CT enables stateful operation by associating packets with a connection. CT checks each packet against existing connections. If the first packet of a new flow enters the system, a new connection will be created. Otherwise the state of the connection will be updated accordingly. Only CT can be used, for example allowing only packets that are associated with an established connection. It is also common to use CT with NFs that want to see the packets in the context of an ongoing connection. NAPT is one of the such NF that make use of CT.
	\item DNAT / SNAT Table : NAT is divided into two DNAT and SNAT. DNAT is responsible of changing the destination IP address or port, whereas SNAT changes source IP or port. DNAT table can be placed in PRE\_ROUINTG and OUTPUT hooks, both before the routing subsystem because the change of destination part would change the routing decision as well. Meanwhile SNAT takes place at LOCAL\_IN and POST\_ROUTING, both before being delivered to the destined host. 
	\item Filter Table : The filter table is used to make decision about whether to allow packet to continue to its destination or drop the packet. Unlike the above tables, when a rule matches only a verdict whether to accept or drop is returned without doing any specific process. This is normally used for Firewall for filtering mechanism. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Netfilter: Rule and Target}
In each table a sequence of rules are installed, which forms a "chain of rules". The rules will be evaluated from top to down in the chain. A rule is registered with a target component, which has function or verdict. Any target returns integer value named verdict which determines how the packet will be handled.
 The verdict value XT\_CONTINUE and XT\_RETURN are special. When the verdict is XT\_CONTINUE the next rule in the chain is further evaluated. And XT\_RETURN means to jump to another rule chain. The other main verdicts are NF\_ACCEPT, NF\_DROP. NF\_DROP tells to discard the packet. NF\_ACCEPT means that the traversal of rule chain terminates in the table and the packet will be further processed by the next table if any or return from the netfilter system to the network stack. 
 
There are following cases when a rule matches: 
\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\arabic{enumi})}
	\item Only a verdict (NF\_ACCEPT, NF\_DROP, etc.) gets returned without doing any process.
	\item Registered function in the target is executed and returns verdict according to the result of the process.
	\item Jump to another rule of chain. 
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{fig: ip_chains} shows an abstract image of traversal of rule chain. 

Rule Chain0 and Rule Chain1 belong to the same table. Smaller boxes in the rule chains represents sets of rule and target. A packet will be evaluated from the top of rule chain until the target's verdict returns NF\_DROP or NF\_ACCEPT. Suppose we get a TCP packet with destination port X and destination IP y.y.y.y and we need to process it through firewall table in figure \ref{fig: ip_chains}. The packet enters rule chain0 for screening and first checked against "UDP port = Y" rule. Since the first rule doesn't match, it proceeds to the next rule "proto = TCP". The second rule matches and therefore the target is executed. The target is a verdict "XT\_RETURN" so the packet jumps to another chain, in this case Rule Chain1 for further screening. The first and second rule in rule chain 1 both don't match so the packet jumps back to the rule chain0 to start from the third rule. The third rule matches so the target  which is a function in a registered kernel module is executed. This function1 returns verdict and if the verdict is either NF\_DROP or NF\_ACCEPT, the screening in this table terminates. If the verdict is XT\_CONTINUE then it continues to the next rule. The last evaluated rule's target decides the verdict of the packet.
